#### Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

*Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala*

**Abstract** <br>
In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision
applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help
bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of
CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints,
and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show
convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts
to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks -
demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.
